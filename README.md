# Low-Level C++ Implementations

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of low-level C++ implementations, designed to help developers understand and master fundamental programming concepts and system-level operations. Each implementation is explained in detail, making it an excellent resource for both beginners and advanced programmers aiming to sharpen their skills in low-level C++.

## 🛠️ Implementations

### 📋 Memory Management
- **`memcpy`**: An optimized implementation of memory copying for non-overlapping regions, leveraging forward copying and potential vectorized operations.
- **`memmove`**: A robust implementation of memory copying that handles overlapping regions safely by determining the direction of copying (forward or backward).

### 🔗 Pointers and Memory
- Detailed examples of working with pointers, memory alignment, and byte-level operations.
- Safe memory manipulation techniques to avoid common pitfalls like segmentation faults and data corruption.

### 🧵 Multithreading and Concurrency (Upcoming)
- Thread-safe implementations of low-level utilities.
- Synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, spinlocks, and atomic operations.

### ⚡ Optimized Data Structures
- Efficient implementations of common data structures with a focus on memory layout and cache optimization.
- Examples include linked lists, custom allocators, and intrusive containers.

### 🌐 System Programming (Upcoming)
- Interaction with operating system APIs for file I/O, process management, and more.
- Low-level network programming with sockets.
